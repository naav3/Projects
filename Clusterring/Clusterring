Using clustering to take the X data (the features/pixels) of the MNIST dataset, 
and group it into clusters.
By not using the targets from the dataset at all.

Then  take the images, ditch their labels, 
and do clustering to group them. You don't know which cluster is which digit. 
then labelled them, or look at each one and say, "looks like 7s", then assign that group a label of 7.
Used GMM to build a function that can generate a new digit from the information in the cluster.
Write a function, writeNumber,
that can take in an integer
